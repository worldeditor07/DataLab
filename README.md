# DataLab

This repo contains various tutorial materials in data science. Each file is an individual practice about methods/techniques that I learned to a previous kaggle competition projects. It basically shows the pipeline for running data exploration, data engineering, plotting, to building models with sklearn packages including random forest, linear regression/classification, svm, simple neural networks.

None of the project were further explored as it is mostly a learning and practicing experience.
